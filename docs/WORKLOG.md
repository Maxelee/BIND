# Work log

Reverse-chronological log of notable sessions: what changed, why, and decisions
worth remembering. Newest entries on top. Keep entries short — link commits and
files rather than restating diffs. (Maintained by Claude Code; see CLAUDE.md.)

## 2026-05-27 — Repo hygiene, branch reorganization, and agent instructions

**Repo cleanup.** The repo had no `.gitignore`, so ~304 untracked items
(2 GB of caches/outputs/figures, committed `.pyc`) were noise. Added a
`.gitignore` (caches, `outputs/`, figures, `*.npz`/`*.npy`/`*.log`, pycache,
notebook checkpoints, machine-local `.claude/settings.local.json`), untracked
the committed `.pyc` files, and refreshed the tracked paper figures. Untracked
count: 304 → 0.

**Branch reorganization.** Decision: keep `main` a clean trunk and park distinct
analyses on topic branches instead of dumping everything on `main`.
- `main` — core engine (`data/model/train/metrics`, `test_suite/`) + the
  ~890-line engine evolution since the last working-model commit + refreshed
  `paper_figures.ipynb`.
- `feature/3d-cube` — 3D / cube-projection extension.
- `analysis/2d` — scatter package, observables, `project1-7`, CV derivatives.
- `wip` — scratch notebooks, parameter-injection experiments, planning notes.

Notebooks are committed with outputs (per preference). No git remote — local-only.

**Agent instructions.** Added `CLAUDE.md` (architecture + commands + conventions
+ data caveats), this `docs/WORKLOG.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
mirroring the project context for GitHub Copilot.
